    <h2>1.3 Background</h2>
        one Safaricom access team's core function is integration of New sites. The speed and accuracy of this deployment has a direct
        on customer satisfaction and company revenue. The team tasked the automation team with the access section to come up with an innovative solution to the deployment process.
        <p>
        Because of the technical nature of access integration process,The access team automation team who have a good understanding of the 
        equipments and also are coding experts,came up with an innovative approach to resolve this impasse.
        </p><p>
        Problems with the old system include
        </p><ul>
        <li>The old system used to take a minimum of two hours. XML preparation and activation is a tedious and rigid process.
        </li><li>Some information such as BSC IP or SCTP port do not come with integration parameters. The user had to manual look for these paramters.
        </li><li>There was little control of parameter Standardizaton. 
        </li><li>batch site activation was almost impossible since association creation on different BSCs would require alot of  preparation.
        </li></ul>

        The new system should allow customers direct access to BSC
        and upload parameters to be used in site creation.
    <h2>1.4 Project Scope</h2>
    The scope of this project is a web-based system that supports the  
    creation of Nokia 2G on BSC. It covers creation on both Flexi BSC and mcBSC. 
    <p>
    Currently this system will not include adjacency creation.

    </p><h2>1.5 System Purpose</h2>
    <h3>1.5.1 Users</h3>
    Those who will primarily benefit from the new system and those who
    will be affected by the new system include
    <dl>
    <dt>Customers:
        </dt><dd>Upon implementation of the new system, Site deployment will be fast and our customers can enjoy better network coverage and availability.
            
    </dd><dt>Access Support team:
        </dt><dd>The new system will provide a quicker and more accurate way of intergrating new sites. Errors faced in the old XML based system will be a thing of the past. <br> The new system also reduces work load on support engineers and will help them focus on netwrok quality issues.
    </dd><dt>Rollout Team:
        </dt><dd>Rolout engineers will have a more reliable time planning since site creation will no longer be a bottleneck. It takes about five minutes to intergarte a site
    </dd><dt>Optimization engineers:
        </dt><dd>The new system helps standardize 2G parameters to ensure the post activation optimization needed is minimal. This is in line with the technology mantra:"Getting it right the first time!"
    </dd></dl>
    <h3>1.5.2 Location</h3>
    The system will be available to any Engineer with access to safaricom LAN or VPN.  Safaricom employees may also use the system from any location
    and will be able to access restricted areas of the site through a password
    protection scheme. 
    <h3>1.5.3 Responsibilities</h3>
    The primary responsibilities of the new system:
    <ul>
    <li> provide accurate and fast system for 2G site integration
    </li><li> Provide a tracker to identify the number of sites created in a given time.
    </li><li> allow differential access to web pages based on
        type of user
    </li><li> accept file input of paramters and deploy as per issued parameters
    </li><li> provide for parameter Standardizaton on agreed values for TRX,CELL and BCF level.
    </li></ul>
    Other desired features of the new system:

    <ul>
    <li>An option to intregrate adjacencies
    </li><li>on option to check if cell is existing in core
    </li><li>A system that doesnt require any input file  from user to create a site.It could fetch the parameters from a DB
    </li></ul>

    <h3>1.5.4 Need</h3>
    This system is needed in order to service the expected increase the efficiency of site deployment.
    The new system will allow Safaricom increase revenue without compromising on the netwrok quality
    <h2>1.6 Overview of Document</h2>
    The rest of this document gives the detailed specifications for the
    new Nokia 2G creation system.  It is organized as follows:
    <ul>
    <li>Section 2: Functional Objectives<br>
    Each objective gives a desired behavior for the system, a business
    justification, and a measure to determine if the final system has
    successfully met the objective.  These objectives are organized by priority.
    In order for the new system to be considered successful, all high
    priority objectives must be met.
    </li><li>Section 3: Non-Functional Objectives<br>
    This section is organized by category.  Each objective specifies
    a technical requirement or constraint on the overall characteristics
    of the system.  Each objective is measurable.
    </li><li>Section 4: Context Model<br>
    This section gives a text description of the goal of the system, and a
    pictorial description of the scope of the system in a context diagram.
    Those entities outside the system that interact with the system are described.
    </li><li>Section 5: Use Case Model<br>
    The specific behavioral requirements of the system are detailed in
    a series of use cases.  Each use case accomplishes a business task
    and shows the interaction between the system and some outside actor.
    Each use case is described with both text and an interaction diagram.
    An interface prototype is also shown.
    The system use case diagram depicts the interactions between all
    use cases and system actors.
    </li><li>Section 6: Class Model<br>
    A class is a collection of objects in the system that have the
    same data and behavior.
    All analysis classes and their relationships are shown on the
    class diagram.
    </li><li>Section 7: An appendix containing a glossary that<br>
    defines terms specific to this project

    </li></ul>
    <a name="Func"><h1>2. Functional Objectives</h1></a>

    <h2>2.1 High Priority</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>The system shall allow for on-line product ordering by either
    the customer or the sales agent.  For customers, this will eliminate
    the current delay between their decision to buy and the placement
    of the order.  This will
    reduce the time a sales agent spends on an order by x%.
    The cost to process an order will be reduced to $y. 
    </li><li>The system shall reflect a new and changed product description within
    x minutes of the database being updated by the product owner.  This will 
    reduce the number of incidents of incorrectly displayed information by x%.  
    This
    eliminates the current redundant update of information, saving $y dollars
    annually.
    
    </li><li>The system shall display information that is customized based
    on the user's company, job function, application and locale.  This feature will
    improve service by reducing the mean number of web pages a user
    must navigate per session to x.  It should reduce unnecessary phone
    calls to sales agents and staff by x%.

    </li><li>The system shall allow employees to view the owner of any product.  
    An employee should be able to contact the correct owner
    in one phone call x% of the time.
    </li><li>The system shall allow a customer to directly contact the nearest sales 
    office in his region.  This will improve service by reducing the time
    to respond to a customer request to no more than x days.
    </li><li>The system shall provide accounting with accurate purchase transaction 
    data.  This will improve customer service by reducing billing complaints
    by x% and save $y in correcting inaccurate accounts.
    </li><li>The system shall provide shipping with accurate order data.  This will
    allow the order to be processed in x days and inventory to be updated 
    within y hours.
    </li></ol>
    <h2>2.2 Medium Priority</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>The system shall provide a search facility that will allow full-text
    searching of all web pages that the user is permitted to access.  The
    system must support the following searches:
    <ul>
    <li>find all words specified
    </li><li>find any word specified
    </li><li>find the exact phrase
    </li><li>Boolean search
    </li></ul>
    </li><li>The system shall make whitepapers available from the product page.  
    This will allow customers to
    answer product questions themselves, reducing customer support
    costs by $x annually. 
    </li></ol>
    <h2>2.3 Low Priority</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>The system shall allow the user's status to be stored for the
    next time he returns to the web site.  This will save the user x minutes
    per visit by not having to reenter already supplied data.
    </li><li>The system shall provide marketing with customer navigation
    information.  This information will allow marketing to determine
    what information prompts a purchase and help target potential
    customers more effectively.  This will increase annual revenue
    by $x in additional sales.
    </li><li>The system shall translate web pages into the languages of
    the countries where the company's products are available.  This
    will improve customer service and reduce the number of support
    calls from foreign customers by x%.
